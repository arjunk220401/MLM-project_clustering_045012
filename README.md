I would like to thank Prof. Amarnath Sir for his guidance on how to perform clustering analysis. He was instrumental in teaching us the core concepts required for acing this particular aspect of machine learning.

The dataset has 100001 rows with 14 variables.

Scikit-learn Documentation: I am grateful to the scikit-learn documentation, which provided comprehensive resources and examples that helped me implement various machine learning algorithms and techniques in this project.


I have broken up my codes and have ensured that I follow the instructions as given.

I have made the report in a separate file and the codes in three different files for ease of reading.

I have also made the box plot and done the numeric encoding as instructed. 

Hope, the project made is up to the mark and please do provide your valuable feedback so that I can improve. Thanks.
