I would like to thank Prof. Amarnath Sir for his guidance on how to perform clustering analysis. He was instrumental in teaching us the core concepts required for acing this particular aspect of machine learning.

All the other information is provided in the report.

Scikit-learn Documentation: I am grateful to the scikit-learn documentation, which provided comprehensive resources and examples that helped me implement various machine learning algorithms and techniques in this project.


Note: Due to an extensive large dataset of 100000 rows, my hierarchial clustering is not coming due to memory storage issue, otherwise k means is coming out perfectly and the code written is right.
